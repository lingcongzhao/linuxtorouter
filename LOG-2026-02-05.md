Claude:
I've created a comprehensive plan. Let me review it and make sure it covers everything the user needs. The plan includes:

1. Technology stack with Go backend, HTMX frontend
2. Full project structure
3. All requested features (iptables, ip rules, routing, interfaces)
4. Authentication with sessions
5. Persistence to files
6. API endpoints
7. Implementation phases
8. Security considerations
9. Verification plan

This looks comprehensive. I should now exit plan mode to get user approval before starting implementation.

Claude:
I've created a comprehensive plan for the Linux Router GUI application. Here's a summary:

## Key Design Decisions

**Backend Stack:**
- Go with `chi` router (lightweight, idiomatic)
- SQLite for user accounts
- `vishvananda/netlink` for interface management
- Direct command execution for iptables/ip commands

**Frontend Stack:**
- Go templates + HTMX (single binary deployment)
- Tailwind CSS via CDN for styling

## Features Covered
1. **Authentication** - Username/password with sessions, user management
2. **Dashboard** - System overview, network stats
3. **Firewall** - Full iptables management (filter/nat/mangle, custom chains)
4. **Routes** - Static route management with multiple table support
5. **IP Rules** - Policy routing rules with priorities
6. **Interfaces** - View/configure interfaces (IP, MTU, up/down)
7. **Persistence** - Save/restore configs on boot via systemd

## Implementation Phases
The plan breaks implementation into 7 phases, starting with project setup and authentication, then building out each feature module.

## Security
- Input validation to prevent command injection
- CSRF protection
- Secure session cookies
- Rate limiting on login
